Hello
This is one of my simple OO designs in Java for Object Oriented Design course at University.

You can run tests with bellow command in Linux terminal or Windows cmd:

    mvn clean install
    
Before that make sure already you have maven in your computer.
Also you need Java.
If you have Intellij, you can run tests easily.
